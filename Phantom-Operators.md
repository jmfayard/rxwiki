## fromFuture( )
#### convert a Future into an Observable, but do not attempt to get the Future's value until a Subscriber subscribes

The `fromFuture( )` method also converts a Future into an Observable, but it obtains this Future indirectly, by means of a function you provide. It creates the Observable immediately, but waits to call the function and to obtain the Future until a Subscriber subscribes to it.

## forIterable( )
#### apply a function to the elements of an Iterable to create Observables which are then concatenated
[[images/rx-operators/forIterable.png]]

`forIterable( )` is similar to `from(Iterable )` but instead of the resulting Observable emitting the elements of the Iterable as its own emitted items, it applies a specified function to each of these elements to generate one Observable per element, and then concatenates the emissions of these Observables to be its own sequence of emitted items.

## generate( ) and generateAbsoluteTime( )
#### create an Observable that emits a sequence of items as generated by a function of your choosing

The basic form of `generate( )` takes four parameters. These are `initialState` and three functions: `iterate( )`, `condition( )`, and `resultSelector( )`. `generate( )` uses these four parameters to generate an Observable sequence, which is its return value. It does so in the following way.

`generate( )` creates each emission from the sequence by applying the `resultSelector( )` function to the current _state_ and emitting the resulting item. The first state, which determines the first emitted item, is `initialState`. `generate( )` determines each subsequent state by applying `iterate( )` to the current state. Before emitting an item, `generate( )` tests the result of `condition( )` applied to the current state. If the result of this test is `false`, instead of calling `resultSelector( )` and emitting the resulting value, `generate( )` terminates the sequence and stops iterating the state.

There are also versions of `generate( )` that allow you to do the work of generating the sequence on a particular `Scheduler` and that allow you to set the time interval between emissions by applying a function to the current state. The `generateAbsoluteTime( )` allows you to control the time at which an item is emitted by applying a function to the state to get an absolute system clock time (rather than an interval from the previous emission).
