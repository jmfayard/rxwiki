RxJava is still a work in progress and has a long list of work documented in the [[Issues|https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/issues]].


If you wish to contribute we would ask that you:
- read [[Rx Design Guidelines|http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rxteam/archive/2010/10/28/rx-design-guidelines.aspx]]
- review existing code and comply with existing patterns and idioms
- include unit tests
- stick to Rx contracts as defined by the Rx.Net implementation when porting operators (each issue attempts to reference the correct documentation from MSDN)
